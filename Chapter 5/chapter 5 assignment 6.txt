7. Random Screen Locations
Write a program that displays a single character at 100 random screen locations, using a timing
delay of 100 milliseconds. Hint: Use the GetMaxXY procedure to determine the current size of
the console window.

use rand64 to select 100 random numbers 1-100 




10. Fibonacci Generator
Write a procedure that produces N values in the Fibonacci number series and stores them in an
array of doubleword. Input parameters should be a pointer to an array of doubleword, a
counter of the number of values to generate. Write a test program that calls your procedure,
passing N = 47. The first value in the array will be 1, and the last value will be 2,971,215,073.
Use the Visual Studio debugger to open and inspect the array contents.

//N=47 . Store the values you get in a doubleword array.
