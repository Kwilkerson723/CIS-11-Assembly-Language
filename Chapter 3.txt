- [ ] 3.4.13 Section Review, Questions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5   
PG. 74 shows the sizes
1. Create an uninitialized data declaration for a 16-bit signed integer.
;SWORD is a 16bit signed integer
Var SWORD ? 
2. Create an uninitialized data declaration for an 8-bit unsigned integer.
Var BYTE ?
3. Create an uninitialized data declaration for an 8-bit signed integer.
Var SBYTE ?
4. Create an uninitialized data declaration for a 64-bit integer.

- [ ] 3.5.5 Section Review Question 3
pg.86,pg78
3. Write a statement that causes the assembler to calculate the number of bytes in the following
array, and assign the value to a symbolic constant named ArraySize:

	myArray WORD 20 DUP(?)   ;DUP operator allocates storage for multiple data items, using a integer expression as a counter
    					;20 WORD, uninitialiezed
	ArraySize = ($ - myArray)


- [ ] 3.9.1 Short Answer, Questions 4, 5, 6, 25

4. Explain why the term assembler language is not quite correct
Because the assembler does not have its own language. It is a program that reads the source file and produces objects. It should be machine language

5. Explain the difference between big endian and little endian. Also, look up the origins of this
term on the Web.
Big endian orders from high to low 
Little endian orders from low to high
Origin 
Danny Cohen "on holy wars and a plea for peace" 1 april 1980 , IEN 137


6. Why might you use a symbolic constant rather than an integer literal in your code?
Because a symbolic constant does not use any memory

25. Which data directive creates a 32-bit signed integer variable?
SDWORD

- [ ] 3.9.2 Algorithm Workbench, Questions 4, 7, 13

4. Find out if you can declare a variable of type DWORD and assign it a negative
value. What does this tell you about the assembler’s type checking?
You can.
It tells me that there is no type checking on dword



7. Declare an array of 120 uninitialized unsigned doubleword values.
	myArray DWORD 120 DUP(?)



13. Declare a string variable containing the word “TEST” repeated 500 times.
