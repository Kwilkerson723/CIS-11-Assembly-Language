- [ ] 2.1.5 Section Review, Questions 1,2,3,4 and 5

1. The central processor unit (CPU) contains registers and what other basic elements?
	The clock
	The control unit
	the aritmetic logic unit

2. The central processor unit is connected to the rest of the computer system using what three
buses?
	Data bus, Address bus, Control bus

3. Why does memory access take more machine cycles than register access?
	because the registers are on the cpu while the computer has to find the memory


4. What are the three basic steps in the instruction execution cycle?
	Fetch, Decode, and Execute.

5. Which two additional steps are required in the instruction execution cycle when a memory
operand is used?
	Fetch the operands and store the result
